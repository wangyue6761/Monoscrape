<b>VULNERABILITY DETAILS</b>
In some Chrome configurations*, a Document PiP window title displays the URL instead of the origin, which can be spoofed due to the fact that the URL is not elided correctly.

<b>VERSION</b>
Chrome Version: 113.0.5672.127 + stable
Operating System: Windows 11

<b>REPRODUCTION CASE</b>
1. Open poc.html
2. Click the button

* I was only able to reproduce this with certain user data profiles, which makes me think that this is caused by a finch feature or similar. I have attached the active variations below, I hope that this will help in figuring out which configuration is causing this to happen.

The bug allows spoofing the apparent origin of a PiP window opened by a website.
