<b>VULNERABILITY DETAILS</b>
If user accepts a virtual credit card suggestion for autofill, ChromeAutofillClient::OnVirtualCardDataAvailable is called after the credit card info was fetched. On android platform, it then calls AutofillSnackbarControllerImpl::Show to show the virtual card snackbar [1]. The problem is that AutofillSnackbarControllerImpl::Show does not check whether there is already a snackbar view. Consider the following scenario:
1. While the first snackbar is showing, the second call to AutofillSnackbarControllerImpl::Show would create another java instance of AutofillSnackbarController at line [2]. Thus there would be two AutofillSnackbarController objects and both of them have a member variable `mNativeAutofillSnackbarView` which is a raw pointer pointing to the same c++ object AutofillSnackbarViewAndroid [3].
2. The first snackbar would be dismissed due to timeout, and it would notify AutofillSnackbarViewAndroid through its java method onDismissNoAction. It then calls AutofillSnackbarViewAndroid::OnDismissed and would destroy AutofillSnackbarViewAndroid at line [4].
3. The second snackbar also be dismissed due to timeout (or perform any action on it), and a UAF would occur when the java object tries to invoke the JNI function and access the already freed AutofillSnackbarViewAndroid.

<b>VERSION</b>
Chrome Version: stable + dev
Operating System: Android

<b>REPRODUCTION CASE</b>
1. Apply the attached browser.diff patch, this is to add an enrolled virtual card and disable the security connection check(https) in autofill, for the convenience of reproduction in the local asan environment.
2. Host poc.html at localhost
python3 -m http.server 8000
adb reverse tcp:8000 tcp:8000
3. Launch chromium and navigate to http://localhost:8000/poc.html
4. Use the virtual card for autofill twice
